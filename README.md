This is site-generator - basically a markdown converter.
Should take all the markdown files from src folder, parse them, convert to html and save (based on the template) in docs folder (which are configured as root for gitpages).

Does not support nested markdown yet, but supports multiple files/folders and markdown: headings, paragraphs, links, images, bold, italic, quote, code, unordered and ordered lists.

Example pages (based on markdown from boot.dev are hosted https://allanjelly.github.io/site_generator/
